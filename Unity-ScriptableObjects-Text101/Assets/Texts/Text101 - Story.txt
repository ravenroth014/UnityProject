You've just woken up and found that you are lied down on the ground. Nothing but a lot of trees surround you. It seems you're left in this forest.
Suddenly, you spot a strange thing near the tree beside you. It's a box, a tiny one. But why is it doing here?

You could try open it to see the inside, or just leave it that way and move toward to find a way out of this forest.

What should you do?
1. Open the box to see what is inside.
2. Ignore it and find a way to get out of the forest.
