    Nothing but a lot of trees surround you. It seems you're left in this forest.\r\nSuddenly,
    you spot a strange thing near the tree beside you. It's a box, a tiny one. But
    why is it doing here?\r\n\r\nYou could try open it to see the inside, or just
    leave it that way and move toward to find a way out of this forest.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should you do?\r\n1. Open the box to see what is inside.\r\n2. Ignore it and find
    a way to get out of the forest."
